### Description & Code

* **The symptoms:**  LCD acting weird OR trouble with usb connection / serial monitor / uploading / etc.
* **The problem :** The LCDs occasionally draw too much power when we turn on the boards, and that makes parts of its serial communications crash.
* **The Solution:** Add this code, and wire a switch up, like the wiring diagram below:



```python
import board
import time
import digitalio
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

# turn on lcd power switch pin
lcdPower = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D8)
lcdPower.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
lcdPower.pull = digitalio.Pull.DOWN

# Keep the I2C protocol from running until the LCD has been turned on
# You need to flip the switch on the breadboard to do this.
while lcdPower.value is False:
    print("still sleeping")
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Time to start up the LCD!
time.sleep(1)
print(lcdPower.value)
print("running")

i2c = board.I2C()
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)


# Loop forever.
while True:

## Servo_button_Control

### Description & Code
* **The symptoms:** The servo would jutter
* **The problem :** The wiring was incorrect somehow 
* **The Solution:** had to spend a long time wiring 



```python
import time
import board
import pwmio
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
from  adafruit_motor import servo



pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

btn1 = DigitalInOut(board.D5)
btn1.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn1.pull = Pull.DOWN

prev_state = btn1.value

btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D2)
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn2.pull = Pull.DOWN

prev_state = btn2.value
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    if btn1.value:
        print("BTN1  is down")  
        for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
            my_servo.angle = angle
      
    if btn2.value:
        print("BTN2  is down") 
        for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
            my_servo.angle = angle
    
    time.sleep(0.35)

```

### Reflection
I quite enjoyed getting to experiment with this new coding languge . the challenges where figuiring out how to translate the things i new over into this whole new coding langauge.

Distance_sensor
### Description & Code
Get a distance sensor too change the color of the Neopixel based on distance
* **The symptoms:** Code wouldnt read a certain file 
* **The problem :** that file wasnt where it needed to be 
* **The Solution:** moved the file to the right spot 


```python
import time
import board
import adafruit_hcsr04  
from rainbowio import colorwheel
import neopixel 
import simpleio

sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D5, echo_pin=board.D6)

pixel_pin = board.NEOPIXEL
num_pixels = 1

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(pixel_pin, num_pixels, brightness=0.3, auto_write=False)

    for i in range(num_pixels):
        pixels[i] = color
        time.sleep(wait)
        pixels.show()
    time.sleep(0.5)


def rainbow_cycle(wait):
    for j in range(255):
        for i in range(num_pixels):
            rc_index = (i * 256 // num_pixels) + j
            pixels[i] = colorwheel(rc_index & 255)
        pixels.show()
        time.sleep(wait)

while True:
    try:

        print((sonar.distance,))
        if (sonar.distance <= 5.0):
            blue = 0
            green = 0
            red = 255

        if (sonar.distance >= 5.0) and (sonar.distance < 20.0):

        print("red =",red," green = ",green," blue = ",blue)    
        pixels[0] = (red,green,blue)
        pixels.show()
    
    except RuntimeError:
        print("Retrying!")

    time.sleep(0.1)

### Reflection
I have never had a nice time with the distance sensors always having them bug out on me, but this time thanks to the help of many teachers and a vast amount of information located on the place called "the internet" and my fellow students Julein and Will for helping me in this project. I mainly struggled with getting the Neopixel to show color but even that was quickly resolved thanks to my teamates.
