## Servo_button_Control
# Henry
# Makes a servo smoothly rotate back and forth



```python
import time
import board
import pwmio
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
from  adafruit_motor import servo



pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

btn1 = DigitalInOut(board.D5)
btn1.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn1.pull = Pull.DOWN

prev_state = btn1.value

btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D2)
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn2.pull = Pull.DOWN

prev_state = btn2.value
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    if btn1.value:
        print("BTN1  is down")  
        for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
            my_servo.angle = angle
      
    if btn2.value:
        print("BTN2  is down") 
        for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
            my_servo.angle = angle
    
    time.sleep(0.35)

### Reflection
I quite enjoyed getting to experiment with this new coding language. the challenge where figuring out how to translate the things I new over into this whole new coding language.

Get a distance sensor too change the color of the Neopixel based on distance

### Reflection
I have never had a nice time with the distance sensors always having them bug out on me, but this time thanks to the help of many teachers and a vast amount of information located on the place called "the internet" and my fellow students Julein and Will for helping me in this project. I mainly struggled with getting the Neopixel to show color but even that was quickly resolved thanks to my teamates.

### Assignment Description

In this assignment our goal was to create a coat hanger In Onshape using skills that we had learned previously in engineering. And also mix in new skills that we just learned for the pourpose of this assignemnt

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
